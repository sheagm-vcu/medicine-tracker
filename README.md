# Medicine Tracker

## Project Overview
The **Medicine Tracker** is an application designed to help users manage their medications efficiently.  
Users can:

- Receive **refill reminders** based on the last fill date and prescription quantity.  

This project aims to improve medication adherence and reduce the risk of missed doses or late refills.
